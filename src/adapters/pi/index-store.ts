/*
 * index-store.ts — seed-index emission at fold events (docs/SEED_INDEX_SPEC.md).
 *
 * On every fold event the adapter (1) appends one `kind:"fold"` record per masked block to the
 * session ledger — the durable recall route: Pi's append-only session file keeps the raw payload,
 * and the record carries the sha256 that lets recall verify what it re-locates there — and
 * (2) appends one deterministic index record to `seed-index.jsonl`. The JSONL is append-only and
 * IS the persistence: resume just keeps appending under later seqs, and `latest record per seq
 * wins` is the consumer contract.
 *
 * The caller treats successful fold-record + index emission as a fold commit precondition. A
 * failure keeps that turn raw rather than creating an unrecallable frozen layer.
