/*
 * cache-telemetry.ts — observe-only prompt-cache accounting from real provider usage.
 *
 * Pi hands every finalized assistant message a `usage` object carrying cacheRead/cacheWrite.
 * This is the measured signal for whether the
 * fold layout is actually keeping the prefix warm: `input` here is the tokens the provider
 * re-prefilled this turn (Pi normalizes it exclusive of cached tokens), so the per-turn hit
 * ratio cacheRead / (cacheRead + input) collapsing right after a fold is the cost of a
 * head-rewriting fold, and staying high is prefix stability paying off.
 *
 * Pure and in-memory: no Pi imports, no persistence — fully unit-testable.
