/*
 * retention.ts — spool GC: bounded on-disk retention for session spools.
 *
 * The spool grows without bound on a 24/7 box (one dir per session, one envelope per fold;
 * nothing ever deletes). This sweep runs once per session at `session_start` and removes WHOLE
 * per-session spool directories whose newest file is older than the retention window.
 *
 * Directory granularity is what makes deletion safe: dedup aliases only ever point at sibling
 * envelopes in the SAME directory, so removing a whole dir can never dangle an alias. And the
 * missing-spool path already fails the right way — resume revalidation drops folds whose spool
 * vanished (they render raw), and a recall on a reaped code throws the typed SpoolError
 * (fail-explicit). GC introduces no new failure mode; it just makes that path reachable
 * by age.
 *
 * The CURRENT session's dir is never touched, whatever its age. Everything here is fail-open:
 * an unreadable entry is kept, a failed delete is skipped — the sweep must never break a session
 * over housekeeping.
 *
 * Liveness vs. fold activity: file mtime alone dates a directory by when it last FOLDED, so a
 * session that folded early and then ran quietly past the retention window would be reaped by a
 * freshly started sibling while still live. Each session therefore refreshes a `.alive` heartbeat
 * in its own dir (see `touchHeartbeat`), which the sweep reads like any other file. The residual
 * edge is a stopped process: it stops heartbeating and can still be reaped.
